  The Florida International
University Powerlifting
Team captured its third straight
Collegiate State Championship
at the Sunshine State Games on
June 14 and 15 at the West Palm
Beach Civic Center in West
Palm Beach, Florida. Due to
injury and a family emergency,
only six FIU lifters competed,
two fewer than usual. Nevertheless,
the lifters who did compete
came up with a monumental
effort to capture five gold medals
and one bronze. <a href="http://www.eli.fiu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Spring20155.pdf"> Click here </a> to read the full article. </p>

  The word “power” doesn’t begin to describe the level of dominance the FIU Power Lifting Team has in the world of collegiate power lifting. This squad is just two years old and has already been able to take their place on the throne as the State Champions, a throne held for seven years by a relatively big school up north by the name of Florida State University. However, if you ask me, the weights are tilted in FIU’s favor. When you’ve got a head coach that is a national champion power lifter like the Golden Panthers have in Coach Bill Hennessey and a three time world champion as your assistant coach in Damian Fronzaglia, there aren’t enough YouTube videos of Arnold Schwarzenegger curling in the gym to help anyone beat this team. <a href="http://fiusm.com/2015/06/04/do-you-even-lift-bro/"> Click here </a> to read the full article. </p>

  The FIU Men’s Powerlifting Team claimed a State Championship win on Sunday, Nov. 16, 2014 at Florida Collegiate Championships at FAU. Led by freshman captain Roman Fronzaglia, the Panthers denied rival Florida State their eighth straight title at the Collegiate Championships. Fronzaglia holds the national record for the deadlift in the 60kg weight class. A deadlift is when a competitor raises the bar from the ground using only the core and lower body muscles. The 130-pound Fronzaglia managed to deadlift 160kg or 352 pounds off the ground, more than two and a half times his weight. The Women’s Powerlifting Team also competed at the Florida Collegiate Championships, but placed second to Florida Gulf Coast in the competition. <a href="http://fiusm.com/2015/01/30/powerlifting-to-a-state-championship/"> Click here </a> to read the full article. </p>

  The Florida International University
Powerlifting Team surprised
the other collegiate teams
in the state with a first-place
finish in the men’s competition
and a second-place finish in the
women’s competition at the Florida
Collegiate Powerlifting
Championships on Sunday, November
16, 2014. The team,
coached by Dr. Bill Hennessey,
an FIU instructor and national
champion, is only in its first year
of existence. “Our victory was
absolutely huge,” Hennessey
said.  <a href="http://www.eli.fiu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Fall20143.pdf"> Click here </a> to read the full article. </p>
